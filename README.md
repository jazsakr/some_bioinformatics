# Hey!

I am Jaz, a PhD student in the Mortazavi Lab at UCI. Before starting the program, I had no experience in bioinformatics or computation. I have never even seen the command line before. Some of this acquired knowledge is recorded here and I hope it might help graduate student or other in some way.

90%, and most likely more, of what you will see here was either taught or shown to me directly by wonderful mentors and colleges, or I learned from great educators on the internet. For this reason, everything is written in the perspective of "we".
